# A few sample indexes for testing
# Collection: testcollection

# Index on a standard field, ascending (1) and descending (-1)
testcollection.foo_1
testcollection.foo_-1

# Index on a sub-field, ascending and descending
testcollection.bar.foo_1
testcollection.bar.foo_-1

# Compound index with two asc fields
testcollection.(foo_1, bar_1)

# Compound index with three mixed fields
testcollection.(bar_1, foo_1, baz_-1)
